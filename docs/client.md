Client (Me) — Business Context & Requirements
Background:

We’re a diagnostic lab chain operating across several cities. Every day, thousands of patients get blood tests, urine tests, and other lab investigations.
We’ve been digitally collecting reports in our system, but our management team wants data-driven insights — not just piles of numbers.

Primary Business Goals:

Quality & Performance Monitoring:

Identify test result trends across time (e.g., increase in infections or anemia cases).

Compare lab performance across branches — sample volume, turnaround time, and abnormal report ratio.

Public Health Insights:

Spot seasonal or regional disease patterns (e.g., dengue season spikes).

Track CRP and infection-related markers to identify possible outbreak trends.

Operational Efficiency:

Monitor test demand (e.g., how many CBCs, liver panels per week).

Predict inventory requirements (reagents, kits) based on usage patterns.

Patient Health Analytics:

Analyze demographic health trends — e.g., anemia prevalence by age/gender.

Build risk stratification dashboards (e.g., “% of reports showing chronic inflammation”).

⚙️ Technical Deliverables (What I, the client, expect you to provide)

Dataset Design & Generation

A realistic, anonymized dataset (like you’re building) simulating 1M+ reports.

Each report includes: patient demographics, test values, diagnosis, lab ID, date.

Optional: disease tags (viral, bacterial, anemia, chronic condition).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary stats (mean, median, variance) for each test parameter.

Outlier detection — false results, abnormal test ranges.

Correlation matrix: how various tests relate (e.g., low Hb ↔ low HCT).

Visualization Dashboards

Infection trends over time.

Anemia distribution by age/gender.

CRP trends to monitor inflammation spikes.

Branch performance dashboards (if multi-branch data included).

Predictive Analytics (Advanced phase)

ML model to classify or predict possible diagnoses from test values.

Predict abnormal CRP levels based on other test markers.

Disease outbreak forecasting using time series.

Deliverables Format

Clean CSV / Parquet dataset.

Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts for analysis.

Dashboard (Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly Dash) for visualization.

Short executive summary report with key insights.
